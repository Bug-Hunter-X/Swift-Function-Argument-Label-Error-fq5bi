This example demonstrates a common error in Swift related to function argument labels.  The `calculateArea` function requires both `length` and `width` parameters, but if the labels are not explicitly included when calling the function, a compilation error will occur. This is because Swift uses labeled parameters by default. The provided solution shows how to fix this issue by including the labels correctly.  This highlights the importance of paying close attention to argument labels in Swift function calls.
